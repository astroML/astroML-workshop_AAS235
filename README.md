## Description

This workshop will introduce the astronomical community to the 2nd edition
of the book Statistics, Data Mining, and Machine Learning in Astronomy and
the associated software package astroML. The goal is to introduce
participants to a variety of statistical and machine learning tools
available within the open source astroML library. The format will be
interactive, including short presentations on different machine learning
methodologies followed by instructor-guided, Jupyter notebook based
tutorials. In these tutorial sessions participants will be able to try out
the tools and to ask questions from expert users and developers.

Our primary focus will be on the new material and applications in the 2nd
edition of the book.
